# Dev Challenges

This repo will contain all code that I code from [devchallenges.io](https://devchallenges.io) projects. The folders have the name of the challenge.
Also, I'll post here any small challenge I code and don't need a big environment to run like react or any other big library or framework. Folders will have the same structure.
